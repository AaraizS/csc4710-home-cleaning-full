Vite + React frontend for the Home Cleaning project

This frontend is a minimal SPA that calls the backend API (expected at http://localhost:5052).

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open the URL printed by Vite (default http://localhost:3000)

Notes:

- The frontend is intentionally simple and meant for demos and manual testing.
- Update `src/api.js` if your backend runs on a different host/port.
- Add form validation, authentication, and file upload handling as needed.
